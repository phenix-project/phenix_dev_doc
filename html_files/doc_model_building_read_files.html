<h2><center>Read in a map and model</center></h2>

<p class="lead mt-4">The very first thing we need to do for model building is to read in experimental data (maps, reflections) and a model. Here, we learn how to read in existing files from the Phenix regression directory.</p>

<p>When you have Phenix installed, you automatically get tutorial, testing, and demo data files that come with Phenix. We’ll use some of those in this tutorial. Let’s make a new directory to work in and put the files we need there. In a terminal window type:</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen"><code>phenix.setup_tutorial tutorial_name=model-building-scripting</code></pre>

<p>This creates the directory model-building-scripting. Let’s change our working directory to this directory:</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen"><code>cd model-building-scripting</code></pre>

<p>It is pretty easy to set up the high-level model-building tools. As an example, let’s read in a map and working model and get ready to fit a ligand into the map.</p>

<p>Type <code>phenix.python</code> to start up Python with the Phenix environment all set up:</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen"><code>phenix.python</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s set up a DataManager that knows how to read and write files. Paste these commands in to your terminal window after starting up with <code>phenix.python</code> (Note: everything after the hash mark is a comment and is ignored, and also note that you are usually not allowed to have spaces before the start of a command):</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>from iotbx.data_manager import DataManager    # Load in the DataManager
dm = DataManager()             # Initialize the DataManager and call it dm
dm.set_overwrite(True)         # Overwrite files with the same name
</code></pre>

<p>The DataManager has many useful functions for reading and writing files. Here we are going to use a function that can read in a map and a model that we specify and that creates a  map_model_manager from the map and model:</p>

<p>The map and model with unmodeled ligand density are in the in the model-building regression directory. Let’s read them in and create a map_model_manager.  Just cut and paste this command into your terminal window:</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>mmm = dm.get_map_model_manager(        # getting a map_model_manager
  model_file="boxed_ligand_map.pdb",   # model file
  map_files="boxed_ligand_map.ccp4")   # map file
</code></pre>

<p>We can summarize the map and model just by typing the word <code>mmm</code>:</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>mmm     # summarize the map_model_manager
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce a short summary of the model-manager (unit cell, space group, number of chains and residues, coordinate shift from its original location), and of the map_manager (original file name, unit cell, space group, gridding of the unit cell, part of the unit cell that is present, and coordinate shift from its original location):</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen"><code>Map_model_manager:

Model manager
Unit cell: (115.986, 115.986, 44.151, 90, 90, 120) Space group: P 6 (No. 168)
Chains: 1 Residues 247
Working coordinate shift (-6.95916000366212, -21.696513667819186, -27.13446935017904))

map_manager:
Map manager (from /Users/terwill/unix/PHENIX/build_2020-04-24/modules/phenix_regression/model_building/boxed_ligand_map.ccp4)
Unit cell: (115.986, 115.986, 44.151, 90, 90, 120) Space group: P 6 (No. 168),
Unit-cell grid: (250, 250, 96), (present: (66, 67, 35)), origin shift (42, 54, 59)
Working coordinate shift (-6.95916000366212, -21.696513667819186, -27.13446935017904)
</code></pre>

<p>First let’s tell the map_model_manager <code>mmm</code> about the resolution of the map. This is used later in fitting the ligand and in model-building.</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>mmm.set_resolution(3.0)    # working (nominal) resolution of map
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s also tell the map_model_manager mmm about the experiment type (cryo_em or xray). This information can be used later in refinement.</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>mmm.set_experiment_type('xray')   # define experiment type
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are ready to work with this map_model_manager containing a map and model. Let’s save a copy so we can come back to this place any time:</p>

<pre class="codeDL"><code>mmm_saved = mmm.deep_copy()   # save a copy of the map_model_manager
</code></pre>
